**Snake Game**<br>
This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Java. The objective of the game is to control a snake and guide it to eat food while avoiding collisions with walls or its own tail. The snake grows longer each time it consumes food, making the game progressively challenging.
<br><br>
**How to Play**<br>
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the movement of the snake.
The snake will move in the direction indicated by the arrow keys.
The snake can't move in the opposite direction of its current movement.
The game ends if the snake collides with a wall or its own tail.
The score increases each time the snake eats food.
Aim to achieve the highest score possible.<br><br>
